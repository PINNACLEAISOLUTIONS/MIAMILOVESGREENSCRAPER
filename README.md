**Miami Loves Green** is a sophisticated, AI-driven lead discovery engine designed specifically for the South Florida landscaping market. It transforms the chaotic process of finding high-ticket outdoor projects—like pavers, sod installation, and tree removal—into a stream of verified, high-intent leads using Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔍 Intelligent Discovery Pipeline
- **Smart Intent Recognition**: Uses natural language processing heuristics to distinguish between homeowners asking for help ("I need sod") and professionals selling services ("We install sod").
- **MCP-Enhanced Search**: Integrates **Exa.ai** and **Brave Search** via MCP to find hyper-relevant discussions on Reddit, Nextdoor, and forums that traditional scrapers miss.
- **Date-Filtering Logic**: Automatically filters out stale posts, ensuring every lead was active within the last 30 days.

### 💻 3D "Miami Night" Dashboard
- **Immersive UI**: Built with a stunning "Miami Night" aesthetic featuring deep teals, neon greens, and glassmorphism styling.
- **Interactive 3D Cards**: Lead cards float and react to user interaction using 3D CSS transforms.
- **Real-Time Stats**: Live counter tracking active, high-quality opportunities found in the current session.

### 🧠 Lead Intelligence App
- **Data Enrichment**: Integrated React application that enriches domain leads with contact info, company size, and social signals.
- **Mobile-First Design**: Fully responsive interface optimized for field use on mobile devices.
